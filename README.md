- 👋 Hi, I’m @drmindsmith
- 👀 I’m interested in constantly improving all my chops, from data analysis and statistics, to being a better dad.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science sequencing - streamlining the process from start to finish. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything educational - I have advanced training in K12 and Higher Ed Administration so I bring deep subject knowledge to those fields. 
- 📫 How to reach me: send me a message or ping me, or hunt me down on LinkedIn.
